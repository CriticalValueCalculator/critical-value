# critical-value
A critical value is a point on the t-distribution that is compared to the test statistic to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis in hypothesis testing. If the absolute value of test statistic is greater than the critical value, statistical significance can be declared as well as null hypothesis can be rejected.
